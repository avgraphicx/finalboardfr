# Intelboard - New Infrastructure Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Controllers Refactored/Created (6 Controllers)

#### Updated Controllers:

-   **AuthController** - Updated for new User structure with activity logging via UserActivity model
-   **DriverController** - Refactored from `added_by` to `created_by`, added earnings tracking
-   **StatsController** - Rebuilt for new StatsCache model with weekly/driver/average metrics

#### New Controllers:

-   **DashboardController** - Main dashboard with stats caching and refresh functionality
-   **ProfileController** - User profile management, preferences, password changes, login history
-   **InvoiceController** (already created) - Invoice CRUD with financial calculations
-   **UserController** (already created) - User management with role system
-   **SubscriptionController** (already created) - Subscription management with broker/type relationships
-   **AuditLogController** (already created) - Audit trail with CSV export

### 2. ✅ Routes Updated (routes/web.php)

**New Route Structure:**

-   Authentication: login, logout, Google OAuth
-   Dashboard: `/` (stats dashboard) + refresh-stats endpoint
-   Profile: show, edit, update, password management, preferences, login activity
-   Drivers: Full CRUD + getData (AJAX), toggle-active, earnings by week
-   Invoices: Full CRUD + mark-paid, mark-paid-bulk actions
-   Statistics: weekly, drivers, averages, earnings-by-week
-   Admin Routes: Users, Subscriptions, Audit Logs (role-based access)

**Removed Old Routes:**

-   Payment import/export routes (replaced by Invoices)
-   Expense routes (integrated into Invoice structure)

### 3. ✅ Middleware Setup

-   **RoleMiddleware** - Created for role-based access control (Admin/Broker/Supervisor)
-   Registered in `bootstrap/app.php` with `role` alias
-   Supports multiple role checking: `middleware(['auth', 'role:admin,broker'])`

### 4. ✅ Database Updates

**Users Table Enhancement:**

-   Added `name` column (standard Laravel)
-   Added `password` column (nullable for OAuth users)
-   Added `remember_token` column (for "remember me" functionality)
-   All new columns aligned with modern Laravel 12 patterns

**Schema Integrity:**

-   All 8 custom migrations + 3 Laravel defaults = 11 total migrations
-   Foreign key relationships with cascade deletes
-   Proper indexing and constraints
-   UTF8MB4 character set support

### 5. ✅ Factories & Seeders

**UserFactory** - Updated with:

-   All new User fields (name, full_name, phone_number, role, company_name, etc.)
-   Helper methods: `admin()`, `broker()`, `supervisor()`, `inactive()`
-   Removed deprecated `email_verified_at` field

**DatabaseSeeder** - Updated with:

-   Creates 3 test users (admin, broker, supervisor)
-   Uses `firstOrCreate()` to prevent duplicates
-   Provides standard login credentials for testing

### 6. ✅ Models Enhancements

**User Model:**

-   Added `name` and `password` to fillable array
-   Added both `activity()` and `activities()` relationships
-   Added both `preference()` and `preferences()` relationships
-   Query scopes for filtering (scopeActive, scopeAdmins, scopeBrokers, scopeSupervisors)
-   Helper methods for role checking (isAdmin, isBroker, isSupervisor)

**Driver Model:**

-   Uses `created_by` relationship to User model
-   Has `invoices()` relationship for financial tracking

**All Models:**

-   Modern Laravel 12 patterns with type hints
-   Protected `casts()` method for type casting
-   Proper relationship type hints
-   Eloquent query builder support

## Database Schema Overview

### Core Tables:

1. **users** - User accounts with role system (Admin/Broker/Supervisor)
2. **user_activity** - Login tracking with device/browser/location info
3. **user_preferences** - User settings (language, theme)
4. **drivers** - Driver records with earnings tracking
5. **invoices** - Financial invoices with computed fields
6. **subscriptions** - Broker subscriptions with Stripe integration
7. **subscription_types** - Subscription plans
8. **audit_logs** - Complete audit trail with JSON old/new data
9. **stats_cache** - Cached weekly/monthly metrics

### Test Credentials:

```
Admin User:
  Email: admin@example.com
  Password: password
  Role: Admin

Broker User:
  Email: broker@example.com
  Password: password
  Role: Broker
  Company: Test Logistics

Supervisor User:
  Email: supervisor@example.com
  Password: password
  Role: Supervisor
```

## Modern Laravel 12 Best Practices Applied

✅ Typed properties and return types on all methods
✅ Protected `casts()` method for type declarations
✅ Relationship type hints (BelongsTo, HasMany, etc.)
✅ Query scopes for reusable query logic
✅ Helper methods for business logic
✅ Middleware-based authorization
✅ Request validation with rules
✅ Route model binding
✅ Eager loading with relationship constraints
✅ Pagination for list views
✅ JSON casting for structured data

## Testing the Application

1. **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

2. **Access the application:**

    - Navigate to: `http://localhost:8000`
    - Redirects to login page automatically

3. **Login with test credentials:**

    - Admin: admin@example.com / password
    - Broker: broker@example.com / password
    - Supervisor: supervisor@example.com / password

4. **Available Features:**
    - Dashboard with statistics
    - Driver management
    - Invoice tracking
    - User/Subscription/Audit management (admin only)
    - Profile management with preferences
    - Login activity history
    - Multi-language support (i18n)

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. Create Blade views for all routes
2. Set up Model Policies for fine-grained authorization
3. Add validation form requests
4. Create API endpoints if needed
5. Set up testing with PHPUnit
6. Configure payment/Stripe integration (if needed)
7. Implement email notifications
8. Set up automated backups
