# Blade Files & Routes Fix Summary

## October 24, 2025 - Post-Migration Updates

### Changes Made

#### 1. **StatsService Updates** (`app/Services/StatsService.php`)

-   ✅ Changed `Payment` model references to `Invoice`
-   ✅ Updated field mappings:
    -   `parcel_rows_count` → `days_worked`
    -   `total_invoice` (sum) → `invoice_total`
    -   `final_amount` → `amount_to_pay_driver`
    -   `broker_van_cut + broker_pay_cut` → `broker_share`
-   ✅ Updated relationship lookups:
    -   `added_by` (old FK) → `created_by` (new FK)
    -   `broker.user_id` → `broker.id`
-   ✅ Fixed earnings calculation to use `broker_share` instead of old formula

#### 2. **DashboardController Updates** (`app/Http/Controllers/DashboardController.php`)

-   ✅ Removed overly simple manual stats collection
-   ✅ Integrated StatsService for comprehensive dashboard data
-   ✅ Updated view path from `dashboard.index` → `pages.dashboards.index`
-   ✅ Removed unused StatsCache model dependency

#### 3. **DriverController Updates** (`app/Http/Controllers/DriverController.php`)

-   ✅ Updated all view paths to use `pages.drivers.*` naming convention
-   ✅ Fixed getData() method to search correct columns:
    -   `name` → `full_name`
    -   `email`, `phone` → removed (not in new schema)
    -   Added `license_number`, `ssn` search fields
-   ✅ Fixed store() validation rules to match new schema:
    -   Removed `name`, `email`, `phone`, `address`
    -   Added `full_name`, `license_number`, `ssn`, percentages/rental price
-   ✅ Fixed update() validation rules similarly
-   ✅ Fixed earnings() method to use `amount_to_pay_driver` instead of calculation method

#### 4. **InvoiceController Updates** (`app/Http/Controllers/InvoiceController.php`)

-   ✅ Updated all view paths to use `pages.invoices.*` naming convention
-   ✅ View paths: `index`, `create`, `show`, `edit` all updated

### Code Quality Checks

✅ **Syntax Validation**: All PHP files checked for syntax errors

-   DashboardController.php - No errors
-   DriverController.php - No errors
-   InvoiceController.php - No errors
-   StatsService.php - No errors

✅ **Bootstrap Testing**: Laravel bootstrap successful
✅ **Database Models**: All references updated to use migrated data

### What's Ready for Testing

1. **Dashboard** - Should display comprehensive stats from migrated data
2. **Drivers Management** - Full CRUD operations on 61 migrated drivers
3. **Invoices Management** - Full CRUD operations on 38 migrated invoices
4. **Statistics** - Service calculates stats based on new schema

### Remaining Tasks

1. Start dev server and test login with migrated users
2. Verify dashboard displays correct stats
3. Test CRUD operations on drivers and invoices
4. Check all view rendering and data display
5. Fix any UI/UX issues that arise
6. Clean up temporary migration files
7. Commit all changes to git
