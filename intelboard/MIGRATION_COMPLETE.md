### Data Integrity Checks

-   ✅ All original IDs preserved
-   ✅ No orphaned driver references in invoices
-   ✅ All foreign key relationships valid
-   ✅ User role enums correctly converted (admin=1, broker=2, supervisor=3)
-   ✅ Invalid timestamps handled (zero-dates replaced with NOW())

## Schema Mapping

### Users Table

-   `full_name` → `name`
-   `role` (ENUM) → `role` (TINYINT: 1=admin, 2=broker, 3=supervisor)
-   `status` → `active` (1=active, 0=inactive)
-   `joined_date` → `joining_date`
-   Broker company names joined from `brokers` table

### Drivers Table

-   All fields preserved directly (driver_id, full_name, license_number, ssn, percentages)
-   `added_by` → `created_by` (defaults to 1 if NULL)
-   `phone_number` field dropped (not in new schema)

### Invoices Table

-   Created from `payments` table
-   `week_number` string parsed to integer (extracts week number from string like "2024-36")
-   `warehouse` → `warehouse_name`
-   `total_invoice` → `invoice_total`
-   `broker_van_cut + broker_pay_cut` → `broker_share`
-   `parcel_rows_count` → `days_worked`
-   `broker_id` set to 0 (not available in legacy data)

### Subscriptions Table

-   `broker_id` preserved
-   `subscription_type_id` from broker's subscription type
-   `stripe_id` → `stripe_subscription_id`
-   Dates converted from TIMESTAMP to DATE format
-   Missing end dates set to 1 year from start

### Subscription Types

-   All fields preserved
-   Invalid zero-timestamps replaced with NOW()

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Test application with migrated data
2. ✅ Verify user logins work with migrated credentials
3. ✅ Check financial calculations on invoices
4. ✅ Ensure drivers display correctly
5. ✅ Test subscription functionality

## Rollback Information

If needed, you can restore from:

-   **iboard_old database**: Contains the original legacy data (still available)
-   **Database backup**: Before this migration was run

To rollback:

```bash
# Restore fresh schema
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

# Then either:
# 1. Use iboard_old as reference to restore specific records
# 2. Restore from database backup
```
